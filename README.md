# E-Commerce Microservices with Go and gRPC

This repository demonstrates an **e-commerce microservices** application built with **Go** and **gRPC**.  
We follow **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to keep business logic decoupled from infrastructure, making the code more maintainable and testable.  
Each service is designed for resilience, fully unit and integration tested, and deployed on **Kubernetes** with an automated **CI/CD** pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focus on domain logic and business rules.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation of core logic and external adapters.
- **gRPC**: High-performance communication between microservices.
- **Resilience**: Strategies to handle failures gracefully during service-to-service calls.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for each layer.
- **Kubernetes**: Containerized deployment with resource definitions for scaling.
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds, tests, and deployments.
